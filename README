Important Notice-
Here is some more detailed information about the scripts I have written.  I do not consider myself a programmer, I create these little programs as experiments to have a play with the language, or to solve a problem for myself.  I would gladly accept pointers from others to improve the code and make it more efficient, or simplify the code.  If you would like to make any comments then please feel free to email me at craig@geekcomputers.co.uk.

In the scripts the comments etc are lined up correctly when they are viewed in Notepad++. This is what I use to code Batch scripts.

cmd.bat - I have used this before when I have been restricted access to the run menu on a PC, this simple batch file will give a cmd window.

defrag.cmd - This is what I used to use to schedule a defrag of my windows PC, I used to have this scheduled to run in the night when I know I wouldn't be on the machine.

itunes.cmd -  This was a very basic script I used to schedule to backup my iTunes library to an external drive. 

lockpc.bat - You could have this on your desktop, so you could simple click on this to lock your PC when you step away from your desk, you could also schedule this to run at a certain time of night.

logoff.bat - This is my custom logoff script, I use this each night to log off my PC at work.

putty_backup.bat - This will backup all of your PuTTY sessions to a .reg file, so you can then copy it around and load them into another machine

start-up.bat - My custom startup batch file.
